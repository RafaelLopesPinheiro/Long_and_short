# Long_and_short
 
This project do cointegration between two assets using Linear regression of the residuals and plot Z-Score and Stats T to confirm if has cointegration or not and Half-life to estimate the time in position.

* Data is downloaded from Yahoo Finance
* Made easy to change and download other assets to check
* Can change the range of the cointegration easily 
* Show the Half life for trading purpose

The user need to run the program, insert in console 2 assets tickers (yahoof finance) then the program will calculate and plot the regression and Z-score indicating if the assets are cointegrated or not to do Long & Short of the assets.

_Ps: Yahoo finance only make available max of 700 days until today (aprox. 2 years), this will be the window of the cointegration between assets._
